Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker host or Swarm cluster.
Portainer is meant to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine (Docker for Linux and Docker for Windows are supported).
Portainer allows you to manage your Docker stacks, containers, images, volumes, networks and more ! It is compatible with the standalone Docker engine and with Docker Swarm.
